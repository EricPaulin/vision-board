            <p class="text2"> I am twenty-one years old and working on getting a bachelors degree in computer
                              science. This class specifically has been a huge help for me as it made me look at
                              life more through a scouts lens which made me consider the choices I've made in life and
                              also made me question who I am and what I want to be. Those conversations with myself 
                              allowed me to become more confident and comfortable with myself, which in turn led me 
                              to focusing more on my passions.

                to turn into reality. One of the outlets I want to express my ideas is through music, so I have been hard at work leanring music theory
                and researching music structure.
